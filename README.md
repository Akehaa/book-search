## About the project

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It uses the [Google Books APIs](https://developers.google.com/books) to search for any book that is in the Google database and return cards with a couple of infos about the founded books. If you want to see more about the wanted book, just click and it will open a new tab with more informations about the book and a link to buy it on google pay.
