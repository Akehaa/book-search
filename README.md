# BookSearch
## About the project

This project uses [React](https://react.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (12), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It uses the [Google Books APIs](https://developers.google.com/books) to search for any book that is in the Google database and return cards with a couple of information about the books. The user can click a card to open a new tab to see more about the selected book and a link to see it on google play.
